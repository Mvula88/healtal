## üìß Email Nurture Sequences

### Sequence 1: "The Pattern Revealer" (7-day)

**Email 1 - Immediately after assessment:**
```
Subject: Your pattern assessment is ready (surprising results)

Hi [Name],

Your assessment revealed something interesting...

You scored high for [PATTERN TYPE]. This usually means there's an unmet need for [DEEPER NEED].

This isn't about willpower. It's about understanding.

[See Your Full Assessment ‚Üí]

P.S. 73% of people with your pattern type find breakthrough insights in their first AI coaching session.
```

**Email 2 - Day 2:**
```
Subject: The real reason you can't stop

Quick story:

Sarah couldn't stop shopping. She tried budgets, accountability, even cutting up credit cards.

Then she discovered she wasn't actually shopping for things.

She was shopping for the feeling of "deserving something nice" - something she never got as a child.

Once she understood that, everything changed.

What are you really shopping/drinking/scrolling for?

```

**Email 3 - Day 3:**
```
Subject: Why 3am is when it hits hardest

Ever notice how the urge is strongest when you're:
- Alone
- Tired  
- Stressed
- After conflict

That's not coincidence. That's information.

Your pattern is trying to tell you something about what you need.

Hi [Name],

I've been following your mental health advocacy - especially your post about [specific post]. Your vulnerability helps so many.

We've built an AI coach that helps people understand the root causes of their patterns (not just cope with symptoms). It's like having a therapist available 24/7 for the cost of Netflix.

Would you be open to trying it free and sharing your honest experience? No scripts, no pressure - just real talk about what you discover.

If it helps you understand something new about yourself, we'd love to compensate you for sharing that journey.

Interested?
